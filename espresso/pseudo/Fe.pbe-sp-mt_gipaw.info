Pseudopotential for Iron including semicore states in 
valence, local part d, gipaw reconstruction included.
Two gipaw projectors per p and d channels, only one
projector on s channel.

This pseudo has been used succesfully to calculate 
band-structure in Ferromagnetic Iron and the XAS/XMCD
spectra in Iron using the XSPECTRA code.
