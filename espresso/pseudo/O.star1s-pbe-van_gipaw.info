Ultrasoft pseudopotential with two gipaw projectors per
s and p channel, only one projector for d-channel.
Local part is d. A core-hole is present in the 1s state.

This pseudopotential has been used to calculate
O K-edge spectra of SiO2 (alpha-quartz) using the XSPECTRA
code.  Results with this pseudopotential are published in:

"First-principles calculations of x-ray absorption in a scheme 
based on ultrasoft pseudopotentials: From alpha-quartz to 
high-Tc  compounds",
