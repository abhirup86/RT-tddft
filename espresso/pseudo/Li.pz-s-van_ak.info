*****  Li_VDB_LDA_SEMI from CPMD
Ultrasoft Li with 1s states in valence, i.e. all-electron!
Info by Axel Kohlmeyer:

   The lithium potential was built from scratch. It gave
   excellent agreement with with previously published values
   and results from other codes/potentials for bulk lithium,
   bulk Li(NH3)4, and bulk LiH.

BEWARE: Matteo Calandra reported seriously wrong results with 
a similar potential (notably in forces and phonon frequencies)
