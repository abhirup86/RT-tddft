# submit espresso job to centurion and info in qjoblog 

# we create a script which has all the information that Portable Batch System (PBS) need to know to run a job on centurion, including
# how many nodes the job need, how many procs on each node the job need, what is the input and what is the output file, how long is the
# walltime of the job and how will this job use the nodes that has been declared, either exclusively using the node or sharing with other
# jobs. The script will be deleted after the job has been submitted and info will be written into qjoblog
# Please make sure you at least take a look at some general PBS tutorial before using it. This following one is pretty simple and captures
# most of the features that we need to run a job
