Ultrasoft pseudopotential with nlcc, gipaw reconstruction
with 2 projectors in p and d channels. 

This pseudopotential has been used to calculate Cu K-edge
XAS spectra in High-Tc compounds in the absence of a 
core-hole in the final state using the XSPECTRA code.

Results are published in

based on ultrasoft pseudopotentials:
