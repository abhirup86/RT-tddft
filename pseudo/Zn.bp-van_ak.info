*****  Zn_VDB_BP.UPF *****  from CPMD

===============================================================
The following pseudopotentials were created with 
version 7.3.4-3 of the pseudopotential creation code
from http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dhv/uspp/

since the pseudopotential code seems to be sensitive to
numerical precision occasionally it was compiled only
with moderate optimization and flags to improve numerical
precision.
the code was compiled on redhat 7.x using the intel 
fortran compiler version 8.1-23 using the flags: 
'-O -mp -pc80 -arch pn3 -tune pn3'

conversion to UPF format from binary .uspp files with
uspp2upf.x taken from PWScf-v2.1cvs-20050304.

the pseudopotentials are all in text-mode and can be read in
directly with recent CPMD version using the FORMATTED flag. if
you still prefer binary pseudopotential files (or have to use
them), you can use the reform utility from
http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dhv/uspp/uspp-735/Utils/reform.f

Naming convention: <Element>_VDB_<DFT>[_(SEMI|NLCC)].UPF
SEMI indicates inclusion of semi-core states in the valence.
NLCC indicates the use of non-linear core correction.
Note: GGA=PW91  LDA=PZ

the 'adapted' pseudopotentials were done by re-creating
the pseudopotential with the same parameters from an
all-electron calculation with a different functional.
There were no additional tests done for them.
Use at your own risk. Please test pseudopotentials befor use.

Recommended plane wave cutoff is 20-40ry (most are optimized for 25ry).
